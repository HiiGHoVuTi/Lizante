# Lizante

Lizante is a parsing library made really quickly for the purpose of ~~flexing~~ learning about Parsers. It uses simple recursive techniques and haskell's laziness to create parse-trees easily, and leads to eye-pleasing grammar code (I hope).

No documentation available yet, you can run the unit-tests using `stack test`, feel free to contribute anything that doesn't break what's already there, and add your own tests as well !
